# Support Ticket App
Your Web Helper was created as a support ticket sytem for customers to seek help when they have problems with their website(s).



## Your Web Helper 
Your Web Helper gives customers of website domains access to technical help regarding their website(s). Customers are able to explain
the problem they are having via the app. A technical support specialist will then be able to see the customer's support ticket and resolve the 
issue accordingly.

### Future Features
A future feature of this app will be the ability to conference with the customer and the technical support specialist  via video/audio directly from within the app.


### How to Use "Your Web Helper"
Step 1. Visit www.yourwebhelper.com
Step 2. Enter your email and password to login. (Being that only customers have access to the app, a password will be emailed to the customer at the time of purchase.)
Step 3. After logging in, go to the top left corner and click "dashboard" to see your support tickets. If you do not have any support tickets,
click "Add New Ticket" to create a new ticket.
Step 4. 


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
