# Support Ticket App
Your Web Helper was created as a support ticket sytem for customers to seek help when they have problems with their website(s).



## Your Web Helper 
Your Web Helper gives customers of website domains access to technical help regarding their website(s). Customers are able to explain
the problem they are having via the app. A technical support specialist will then be able to see the customer's support ticket and resolve the 
issue accordingly.
